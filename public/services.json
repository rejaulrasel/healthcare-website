It has various causes, one of which is infection by a virus. HBV is one of five hepatitis viruses identified so far that are known to mainly infect the liver. The other four are hepatitis A, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E. The virus multiplies in the liver cells and in the process destroys the cells.Without proper diagnosis and treatment on time, chronic HBV infection can lead to fatal liver problems like cancer and it is known to be the 10th leading cause of death in the world.Quantification of viral load, which involve Real Time PCR, allow detection in the range 50 to 5X10^9 copies/ml which is the crucial issue in the management of chronic Hepatitis especially for the assessment of the baseline viral load prior to the initiation of therapy and monitoring patients response to the drugs.Quantitative PCR tests allow detection in the range 50 to 5X10^9 copies/ml which helps in the assessment of prognosis and disease progression.","reasons":"When patient have risk factors for HBV infection primarily a positive HBsAg test result means that patient are infected and can spread the hepatitis B virus or when patient have signs and symptoms of hepatitis, such as jaundice or unexplained elevated blood levels or when patient are being treated for HBV or hepatitis C (HCV)."},{"id":2,"title":"Hepatitis B virus DNA (Genotyping)","img":"https://i.ibb.co/n047Txf/hepatysis-b-dna.png","needed":"To determine a patient’s hepatitis B virus genotype (A-H) and to detect a viral mutation that may be associated with resistance to current treatments.","description":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double stranded DNA virus which infects the liver of humans characterized by inflammation & sometimes enlargement of the liver. It has various causes, one of which is infection by a virus. HBV is one of five \"hepatitis viruses\" identified so far that are known to mainly infect the liver. The other four are hepatitis A, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E. The virus multiplies in the liver cells and in the process destroys the cells.Without proper diagnosis and treatment on time, chronic HBV infection can lead to fatal liver disease like cancer and it is known to be the 10th leading cause of death in the world. Approximately 600,000 deaths occur every year as a result of the acute and chronic consequences of HBV infection. Disease chronicity rates are ?5% in generally healthy infected adults and 80–90% in perinatally infected children. Chronic HBV affects nearly 350 million patients worldwide and may further progress to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 15–40% of cases.HBV genotyping is important in determining the clinical manifestation of disease and treatment response, particularly, in patients with low viral loads. The Virus shows high genetic diversity with 8 genotypes (A-H) and several subtypes. Also, sensitive detection of HBV antiviral drug resistance mutations is essential for monitoring anti-virul response. Genotyping and Resistance Mutation Detection: The RT region of the HBV genome is amplified by end point PCR and loaded on to 1% agarose gel.The PCR product is then purified and subjected to automated sequencing by sanger’s method. The resultant sequence data is then analyzed both manually and by software. The analyzed data is then compared with the database to detect genotype and mutations.","reasons":"When patient have risk factors for HBV infection primarily “a positive HBsAg test result means that patient are infected and can spread the hepatitis B virus or when patient have signs and symptoms of hepatitis, such as jaundice or unexplained elevated blood levels or when patient are being treated for HBV or hepatitis C (HCV)."},{"id":3,"title":"COVID-19 Test","img":"https://i.ibb.co/wgd9ys4/210817-covid-test-houston-ew-346p-823193.jpg","needed":"Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. Its especially important to wash: Before eating or preparing food. Before touching your face.","description":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.","reasons":"Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth."},{"id":4,"title":"Diabetes Diagnosis","img":"https://i.ibb.co/G2zMHzh/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diabetes.png","needed":"Depending on what type of diabetes you have, blood sugar monitoring, insulin and oral medications may play a role in your treatment. Eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight and participating in regular activity also are important factors in managing diabetes.","description":"People with type 1 diabetes need insulin therapy to survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.Many types of insulin are available, including short-acting (regular insulin), rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your doctor may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use throughout the day and night.Insulin cant be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulins action. Often insulin is injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen — a device that looks like a large ink pen.An insulin pump also may be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a small cellphone worn on the outside of your body. A tube connects the reservoir of insulin to catheter thats inserted under the skin of your abdomen.A tubeless pump that works wirelessly is also now available. You program an insulin pump to dispense specific amounts of insulin. It can be adjusted to deliver more or less insulin depending on meals, activity level and blood sugar level.In September 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first artificial pancreas for people with type 1 diabetes who are age 14 and older. A second artificial pancreas was approved in December 2019. Since then systems have been approved for children older than 2 years old.An artificial pancreas is also called closed-loop insulin delivery. The implanted device links a continuous glucose monitor, which checks blood sugar levels every five minutes, to an insulin pump. The device automatically delivers the correct amount of insulin when the monitor indicates its needed.There are more artificial pancreas (closed loop) systems currently in clinical trials.","reasons":"Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often appear suddenly and are often the reason for checking blood sugar levels. Because symptoms of other types of diabetes and prediabetes come on more gradually or may not be evident, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended screening guidelines. The ADA recommends that the following people be screened for diabetes."},{"id":5,"title":"Creatinine Blood Test","img":"https://i.ibb.co/D1vVm5g/creatinine-blood-test.jpg","needed":"A creatinine blood test doesn’t require much preparation. Fasting isn’t necessary. You can and should eat and drink the same as you do normally to get an accurate result.However, it’s important to tell your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications you’re currently taking. Some drugs may increase your creatinine levels without causing kidney damage and interfere with your test results. Let your doctor know if you take:","description":"A creatinine blood test measures the level of creatinine in the blood. Creatinine is a waste product that forms when creatine, which is found in your muscle, breaks down. Creatinine levels in the blood can provide your doctor with information about how well your kidneys are working.Each kidney has millions of small blood-filtering units called nephrons. The nephrons constantly filter blood through a very tiny cluster of blood vessels known as glomeruli. These structures filter waste products, excess water, and other impurities out of the blood. The toxins are stored in the bladder and then removed during urination.Creatinine is one of the substances that your kidneys normally eliminate from the body. Doctors measure the level of creatinine in the blood to check kidney function. High levels of creatinine may indicate that your kidney is damaged and not working properly.Creatinine blood tests are usually performed along with several other laboratory tests, including a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test and a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). These tests are done during routine physical exams to help diagnose certain diseases and to check for any problems with your kidney function.","reasons":"It’s important to note that normal and abnormal ranges can vary among labs because some use unique measurements or test different samples. You should always meet with your doctor to discuss your test results in more detail. They’ll be able to tell you if more testing is necessary and if any treatment will be required."},{"id":6,"title":"HIV Diagnosis","img":"https://i.ibb.co/gTskB9j/HIV-Video.jpg","needed":"Everyone with HIV infection, regardless of the CD4 T cell count or symptoms, should be offered antiviral medication.Remaining on effective ART with an undetectable HIV viral load in the blood is the best way for you to stay healthy.For ART to be effective,its important that you take the medications as prescribed, without missing or skipping any doses. Staying on ART with an undetectable viral load helps:","description":"Blood tests are the most common way to diagnose HIV. These tests look for antibodies to the virus that the body creates in an attempt to fight the virus.People exposed to the virus should get tested immediately, although it can take the body anywhere from six weeks to a year to develop antibodies to the virus. Follow-up tests may be needed depending on the initial time of exposure.Early testing is crucial. If you test positive for the virus, you and your doctor will discuss and develop a treatment plan that can help fight HIV and ward off complications. Early testing also can alert you to avoid high-risk behavior that can spread the virus to others.Most health care providers offer HIV testing, often with appropriate counseling. Anonymous and free testing also is available. During testing, your doctor will ask about your symptoms, medical history and risk factors, and perform a physical examination.","reasons":"HIV testing, also called HIV screening, is the only way to know if you have the virus. Several types of tests check your blood or other body fluids to see whether you are infected. Most can not spot HIV right away, because it takes time for your body to make antibodies or for enough of the virus to grow inside you."},{"id":7,"title":"Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) DNA","img":"https://i.ibb.co/xCPLfM3/3.png","needed":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA test can detect active pulmonary TB through the identification of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR.","description":"Tuberculosis (TB), one of the oldest known human diseases is still one of the major causes of mortality, since two million people die each year. TB has many manifestations, affecting bone, the central nervous system, and many other organ systems, but it is primarily a pulmonary disease that is initiated by the deposition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.The MTB is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for qualitative detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA diagnosis. DNA Solution Limited offers detection of all members of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex, including M.tuberculosis, M.bovis, M.africanum, M.microti, M.canetti, M.pinipedii. It is a real-time PCR based test that can clinically identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA.","reasons":"Individual suffering from coughing that lasts three or more weeks, coughing up blood, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, chills and loss of appetite should be recommended to do MTB DNA test."},{"id":8,"title":"Dengue and Chikungunya","img":"https://i.ibb.co/19BrtPG/4.png","needed":"Diagnose of dengue and chikunguniya virus infection (CHIKV) and to monitor treatment outcome.","description":"Dengue is fast emerging pandemic-prone viral disease in many parts of the world. Dengue flourishes in urban areas, suburbs and the countryside but also affects more affluent neighborhoods in tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection causing a severe flu-like illness and, sometimes causing a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. The incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years. Up to 50-100 million infections are now estimated to occur annually in over 100 endemic countries, putting almost half of the world’s population at risk.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an insect-borne virus, of the genus Alphavirus, is spread by Aedes mosquitoes. Chikungunya infection causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.","reasons":"When patient have symptoms like rash, pain in the lower back, joint pain, vomiting, nausea, headaches and fevers, he/she need to test dengue and chikungunya for proper diagnosis"}]
