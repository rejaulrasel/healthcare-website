        title: "Coronavirus reinfection: How long might 'natural immunity' last?",
        author: "Written by Hannah Flynn MS",
        description: "According to Our World in Data, nearly half of the world’s population have received at least one dose of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Scientists have shownTrusted Source that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the severity of illness but do not confer complete protection against COVID-19.At the beginning of the pandemic, some jurisdictions, including those in the United Kingdom and Sweden, pursued a policy of herd immunity, which assumed that allowing enough people to catch the virus would confer enough immunity on the population to end the pandemic.While there have been some reports of people developing COVID-19 more than once, these numbers are too small to carry out an epidemiological study. This means that it is difficult to determine how long immunity conferred from a SARS-CoV-2 infection lasts.In the present study, researchers have conducted an analysis of previously published data on viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. They set out to determine how long immunity following COVID-19 might last.The research, which appears in The Lancet Microbe, shows that unvaccinated people can expect immunity against reinfection to last 3–61 months after developing COVID-19 — if the virus is still circulating in the community.This study could help encourage people to get vaccinated, said Dr. Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved in the research. He told Medical News Today."

        description: "Depending upon the severity of symptoms, most individuals recover from COVID-19 within the first 3–4 weeks after contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Yet, a significant number of individuals experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms for weeks and months after this initial or acute phase of the infection.People have collectively described these persistent COVID-19 symptoms with terms such as long COVID, post-acute COVID-19,or post-COVID-19.Some of the common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, breathing difficulties, insomnia, pain, and brain fog. Additionally, post-COVID-19 can adverselyTrusted Source impact multiple organ systemsTrusted Source, including the kidneys, lungs, pancreas, and heart."

        title: "What’s the link between mental health and allergies?",
        description: "A new study of data from the UK Biobank confirms the correlation between allergies and mental health. However, correlation does not imply causation, and the study also finds it unlikely that allergies cause mental health conditions or vice versa.The researchers used Mendelian randomizationTrusted Source to investigate possible gene-level causal relationships between mental health disorders and allergies in general — as well as asthma, AD, and hay fever, specifically.These mental health conditions included depression,major depressive disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and neuroticism. The researchers concluded,We did not find evidence of causal effects between allergic disease genetic risk and mental health.”Senior study author Dr. Hannah Sallis, a senior research associate in genetic epidemiology at Bristol Medical School, explains that the study ultimately utilized a variety of methodologies and data to reach its conclusions. This helps to strengthen our confidence in the findings. Establishing whether allergic disease causes mental health problems, or vice versa, is important to ensure that resources and treatment strategies are targeted appropriately.The study has been published in the journal Clinical and Experimental AllergyTrusted Source.The team analyzed data in the in the UK Biobank from individuals aged 37–73 years. However, all were of European ethnicity, so the study’s results may not apply to everyone.The authors acknowledge another limitation, that “Phenotypic analyses were restricted to older adults, so findings may not generalize to younger populations.”"

        description: "Skeletal muscle enables the body to move and maintain posture. Direct injury — for instance, from trauma — can impair a person’s movement and quality of life. People have been using massage and other mechanotherapies for thousands of years to soothe aching and injured muscles. However, the science behind the effects of massage has not been examined in detail.“Lots of people have been trying to study the beneficial effects of massage and other mechanotherapies on the body, but up to this point, it hadn’t been done in a systematic, reproducible way,” explains lead author of the current study Dr. Bo Ri Seo, Ph.D.“Our work shows a very clear connection between mechanical stimulation and immune function,” he continues."

        description: "Since its emergence toward the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world. Cases of COVID-19, which is the disease that SARS-CoV-2 causes, have officially been reported in almost every country — as have deaths to the disease. To date, there have been more than 4.8 million confirmed deaths globally.A small number of countries have reported no cases or deaths. One of these countries is Turkmenistan.

        description: "A study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases has predicted a severe influenza outbreak once COVID-19 control measures are lifted, with increased levels of flu in the following years.The researchers from Columbia University Mailman School of Health used computer modeling to quantify the reduction in transmission and incidence of flu after the implementation of control measures. They used these data together with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView websiteTrusted Source to project influenza transmission over the next 5 years Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, travel restrictions, and school closures, led to a 60% drop in flu infections during the 10 weeks after their introduction last year. The study suggests that the reduced exposure to flu during the control measures will have led to reduced immunity."

        title: "DNA vs. mRNA vaccines: Similarities and differences",
        author: "Written by Ryan Harris",
        description: "Enzymes in the nucleus convert the viral or bacterial gene that the plasmid carries into messenger RNA (mRNA)Trusted Source. The mRNA must then travel to the cytoplasm, where enzymes convert into a bacterial or viral protein.The immune system identifies the bacterial or viral protein as a foreign body and elicits an immune response. The response tends to be gradual because the immune system has not previously encountered the bacterial or viral protein.Vaccination causes memory immune cells to form. When an infection occurs, these cells quickly recognize the bacterium or virus and prevent severe disease.Plasmid DNA degrades within a few weeks, but these memory immune cells provide continued immunity against the pathogen."
